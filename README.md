<p>The <b>Ask Relevance widget</b> lets you embed an AI support assistant into your app in one line of code. ‚ö°Ô∏èüîÆüß™</p> 
</div>

## Installation
To integrate Ask Relevance into your app, include this snippet in your HTML head element.
```html
<script src="" config="BASE64_CONFIG" defer />
```

```ts
// TODO: Documentation on config
```

## Development

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is used for package management and running scripts. 

```shell
# Install Bun if you don't have it:
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install dependencies
bun i

# Start local dev server
bun run dev
```

[Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) is used as the framework due to its small bundle size and excellent performance.

[Trunk](https://trunk.io/) is used for formatting and linting. You can either:
- install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Trunk.io) which handles setup and automatic format/lint automatically
- use the executable at the repo root (`./trunk`)

Check the [docs](https://docs.trunk.io/docs/check-cli) for the CLI API.
